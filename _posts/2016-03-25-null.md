description: "If you want to get lost in an adventure that takes you on the ride of your life, and are open to letting that kid that's inside you loose, then checkout Willow. Willow is really a story of our modern life. It's a battle between wise and the unwise... (I have reframed good and evil into these new terms for those who are wondering). Although set in the times of kings and queens, knights and fairies, The movie takes us on an adventure, and shows us what it takes to bring about an outcome that is truly worthy. In this case to save the life of Princess Aurora, who brings the downfall of the evil empire of Queen Bavmorda played by Jean Marsh. The unlikely hero who brings everyone together is a elvin (migit) named Willow Ufgood played by Warwick Davis, and joins up with the unlikeliest of heros, a thief and once a knight to the king, Madmartigan played by Val Kilmer and Sorsha - Queen Bavmorda's daughter played by Joanne Whalley who is caught between what's wise and her connection for recognition from her mother. The story really teaches us that any pure pursuit takes guts, courage, some set backs, blood, sweat and tears, but whats pure and based in love will prevail, and to have faith most of all, when things are looking the worst. This movie is a must watch, and worthy or purchase on whatever format into your private collection!"
