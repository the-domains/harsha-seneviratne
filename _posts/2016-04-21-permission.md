There is a delicate balance of understanding 'who you are now' and 'who you aspire to become'. Once we accept you, your core nature, and juggling whatever that's going on in your life so you can focus on 'being you' more of the time, then we can focus on working towards become who you aspire to be. This all comes about by giving yourself permission to do it!"

My core teachings are focused on giving you permission to be yourself. It's at the heart of who you are. There is a delicate balance of understanding 'who you are now' and 'who you aspire to become'. Once we accept you, your core nature, and juggling whatever that's going on in your life so you can focus on 'being you' more of the time, then we can focus on working towards become who you aspire to be. This all comes about by giving yourself permission to do it!
