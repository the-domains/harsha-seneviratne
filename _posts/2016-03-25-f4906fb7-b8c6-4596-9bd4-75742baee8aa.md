My purpose in being an Actor is to provide you with tools to awaken you. I direct my artform towards film, interviews, and training videos that are there to awaken you to more of who you are as a human being. To realise this I ask the question - What can we do with Film and Acting? I think beyond entertainment it can really help humanity to shape the course of our destiny as a race. What do I mean by this?... Well if we look at the Film as an Art form, then when we become the consumer of these products, we are really absorbed into say watching a movie on multiple levels. Emotionally through the highs and lows in the journey of the character; Mentally figuring out what's going to happen to the people we connect with in the film; Physically by laughing, crying when things happen; and even Spiritually when the film opens us up to another facet of our very existence and creation, and Awakens us!
