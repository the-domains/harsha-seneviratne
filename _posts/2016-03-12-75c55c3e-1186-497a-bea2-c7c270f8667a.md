Acting is the worst possible word we could come up with for such a Magical Artistic Form. Really when two people are in a scene, and 'acting', and its 'real', then they are far from acting,... they are connecting on a level that's so real. There is a magic that's created that the audience experiences first hand... the actors find the moment and bring the characters to life, fuelled by their spirits. It's far from acting its simply being! That sums up why I love acting so much, I think in a scene, we are free to be in the moment, and perhaps if in our real lives and relationships, if we stopped and found the moments, then that magic can be created by everyone of us to experience first hand. So next time you are with someone, find the moment, that magic moment!
