This allows massive shifts for you holistically, but you get to first hand take control of bringing about that change. Stay tuned for a preview of the course, and I will offer you to access parts of it for free so you can taste test to see whether its for you or not.

Really when two people are in a scene, and 'acting', and its 'real', then they are far from acting,... they are connecting on a level that's so real. There is a magic that's created that the audience experiences first hand... the actors find the moment and bring the characters to life, fuelled by their spirits. It's far from acting its simply being! That sums up why I love acting so much, I think in a scene, we are free to be in the moment, and perhaps if in our real lives and relationships, if we stopped and found the moments, then that magic can be created by everyone of us to experience first hand. So next time you are with someone, find the moment, that magic moment and be really there!</p></div></div></div><div class="Component j-c-center a-i-center p-1 color-title " data-reactid="87"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1" data-reactid="88"><a class="" data-reactid="89"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="90"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="91"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/26be260c7a252252cc676536f4881c6a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff3a14acb-6388-4c80-a19d-7807c0a6a334.jpg&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:74.21875% 79.6875%;" data-reactid="92"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/26be260c7a252252cc676536f4881c6a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff3a14acb-6388-4c80-a19d-7807c0a6a334.jpg&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:74.21875% 79.6875%;" data-reactid="93"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/cd69b02be19525a21b9cdf92f60ead28/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff3a14acb-6388-4c80-a19d-7807c0a6a334.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:74.21875% 79.6875%;" data-reactid="94"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/096980eac89a3f1decf32049f13dc15a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff3a14acb-6388-4c80-a19d-7807c0a6a334.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:74.21875% 79.6875%;" data-reactid="95"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="1280" data-height="960" data-ratio="1.3333333333333333" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/26be260c7a252252cc676536f4881c6a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Ff3a14acb-6388-4c80-a19d-7807c0a6a334.jpg&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:74.21875% 79.6875%;" data-reactid="96"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1" data-reactid="97"><!-- react-empty: 98 --><!-- react-empty: 99 --><!-- react-empty: 100 --><!-- react-empty: 101 --><!-- react-empty: 102 --><div class="Paragraph ls-t-a-j" data-reactid="103"><p>My purpose in being an Actor is to provide you with tools to awaken you. I direct my artform towards film, interviews, and training videos that are there to awaken you to more of who you are as a human being. To realise this I ask the question - What can we do with Film and Acting? I think beyond entertainment it can really help humanity to shape the course of our destiny as a race. What do I mean by this?... Well if we look at the Film as an Art form, then when we become the consumer of these products, we are really absorbed into say watching a movie on multiple levels. Emotionally through the highs and lows in the journey of the character; Mentally figuring out what's going to happen to the people we connect with in the film; Physically by laughing, crying when things happen; and even Spiritually when the film opens us up to another facet of our very existence and creation, and Awakens us!</p></div></div></div></section><section id="6" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="104"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="105"><p>If you want to get lost in an adventure that takes you on the ride of your life, and are open to letting that kid that's inside you loose, then checkout Willow. Willow is really a story of our modern life. It's a battle between wise and the unwise... (I have reframed good and evil into these new terms for those who are wondering). Although set in the times of kings and queens, knights and fairies, The movie takes us on an adventure, and shows us what it takes to bring about an outcome that is truly worthy. In this case to save the life of Princess Aurora, who brings the downfall of the evil empire of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0011998/">Queen Bavmorda</a> played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0550577/">Jean Marsh</a>. The unlikely hero who brings everyone together is a elvin (migit) named <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0011995/">Willow Ufgood</a> played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001116/">Warwick Davis</a>, and joins up with the unlikeliest of heros, a thief and once a knight to the king, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0011994/">Madmartigan</a><b></b>played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000174/">Val Kilmer</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0011997/">Sorsha</a> - Queen Bavmorda's daughter played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000695/">Joanne Whalley</a> who is caught between what's wise and her connection for recognition from her mother. The story really teaches us that any pure pursuit takes guts, courage, some set backs, blood, sweat and tears, but whats pure and based in love will prevail, and to have faith most of all, when things are looking the worst. This movie is a must watch, and worthy or purchase on whatever format into your private collection!</p><picture>

I direct my artform towards film, interviews, and training videos that are there to awaken you to more of who you are as a human being. To realise this I ask the question - What can we do with Film and Acting? I think beyond entertainment it can really help humanity to shape the course of our destiny as a race. What do I mean by this?... Well if we look at the Film as an Art form, then when we become the consumer of these products, we are really absorbed into say watching a movie on multiple levels. Emotionally through the highs and lows in the journey of the character; Mentally figuring out what's going to happen to the people we connect with in the film; Physically by laughing, crying when things happen; and even Spiritually when the film opens us up to another facet of our very existence and creation, and Awakens us!","keywords":[]},"content":[{"id":"1e506411-8911-4f63-a407-8f48c2f8095d","item":"f4906fb7-b8c6-4596-9bd4-75742baee8aa","type":"image","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_html":"<picture>\n
